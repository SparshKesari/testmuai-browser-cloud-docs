# Skills

🔜 Coming Soon

Skills are pre-built browser capabilities packaged as tools for AI agent
frameworks. Instead of writing browser automation code, your agent declares
what it needs and the Skill handles everything - session creation, browser
interaction, data extraction, and cleanup - all powered by TestMu AI Browser
Cloud.
