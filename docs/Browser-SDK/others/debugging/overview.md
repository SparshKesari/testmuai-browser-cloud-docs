# Debugging & Observability

Watch, replay, and debug your agent's browser sessions.


### Why Built-In Debugging?

When your agent runs at 3am and does something unexpected, you need to know
exactly what happened. Every TestMu session runs on LambdaTest's infrastructure,
which means every session automatically comes with video recordings, console
logs, and network request capture — no extra setup required.


### LambdaTest Dashboard

Every session appears on the LambdaTest Automation Dashboard:

```
https://automation.lambdatest.com/logs/
```

From the dashboard you can:

- Watch **live video** of the browser as your agent interacts with it
- **Replay** recorded sessions after they complete
- View captured **console logs**
- Inspect **network requests**
- Review **screenshots**
- Check **test results** (pass/fail)


### Organizing Sessions

Use `build` and `name` in `lambdatestOptions` to organize sessions on the
dashboard. This is especially helpful when running multiple agents or scenarios:

```typescript
const session = await client.sessions.create({
    lambdatestOptions: {
        build: 'Price Monitor Agent — v2.1',
        name: 'Extract Competitor Pricing — Amazon',
        'LT:Options': {
            username: process.env.LT_USERNAME,
            accessKey: process.env.LT_ACCESS_KEY,
            video: true,     // Record video
            console: true,   // Capture console logs
        }
    }
});
```


### Debug URLs

Every session provides URLs for viewing:

```typescript
console.log(session.debugUrl);          // Dashboard URL for this session
console.log(session.sessionViewerUrl);  // Live stream of the browser
```


### SDK Console Output

The SDK logs connection steps and actions to stdout:

```
Adapter: Connecting to session session_123_abc via Puppeteer...
Adapter: Set stealth user-agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0...
Adapter: Set stealth viewport: 1907x1063
Adapter: Humanized interactions enabled
Adapter: Loading profile my-app-login
```


### Common Issues

**Connection Timeout**

```
Error: Timed out after 30000ms while waiting for the WebSocket
```

Causes: Invalid `LT_USERNAME` or `LT_ACCESS_KEY`, LambdaTest service outage,
or network firewall blocking WebSocket connections.

Fix: Verify your credentials, check the LambdaTest status page, try a different
network.


**Session Not Found**

```
Session session_xyz not found
```

Cause: Session was already released or timed out. The default timeout is 5
minutes.

Fix: Increase with `timeout: 600000` (10 minutes) in your session config.


**Playwright Requires Node 18+**

```
Playwright requires Node.js 18 or higher.
```

Fix: Upgrade Node.js with `nvm install 18 && nvm use 18`.


**Profile Not Loading**

Cause: On the first run, there's no saved profile yet.

Fix: This is normal. The profile is created when `browser.close()` is called.
Subsequent runs will load it.
