# Profiles

Persist browser state across sessions and script runs.

Reuse auth, cookies, and browser settings across sessions.


### What Are Profiles?

Profiles save your browser's state - cookies, localStorage, sessionStorage - to
disk so it persists across separate script runs. Think of a profile as a saved
browser identity: a set of credentials, preferences, and session data that your
agent can load each time it runs.

You might have a "salesforce-login" profile, a "github-login" profile, or a
"competitor-research" profile - each maintaining its own authentication state
and preferences.


### Why Profiles?

The [Context Service](../context/overview.md) transfers state between sessions
within a single script run. But what if your agent runs on a cron schedule, or
as a serverless function, or is manually triggered days apart? The in-memory
context is lost between runs.

Profiles solve this. Your agent logs in once, the profile saves the auth state
to disk, and every future run - hours, days, or weeks later - loads the saved
state and skips login entirely.


### How It Works

1. You set `profileId` in your session config
2. On connect, the adapter checks for a saved profile at `.profiles/{profileId}.json`
3. If found, the saved cookies are loaded into the browser
4. On `browser.close()`, the current cookies are automatically saved back to the file
5. Next time you create a session with the same `profileId`, the saved state is restored


### Getting Started

```typescript
// Run 1: Your agent logs in. Profile is saved automatically on close.
const session = await client.sessions.create({
    adapter: 'puppeteer',
    profileId: 'my-app-login',    // This ID enables auto-save
    lambdatestOptions: { ... }
});

const browser = await client.puppeteer.connect(session);
const page = (await browser.pages())[0];

await page.goto('https://app.example.com/login');
// ... agent logs in ...

await browser.close();  // ← Profile auto-saved here
await client.sessions.release(session.id);
```

```typescript
// Run 2 (days later): Agent loads saved state. No login needed.
const session2 = await client.sessions.create({
    adapter: 'puppeteer',
    profileId: 'my-app-login',   // Same ID = loads saved cookies
    lambdatestOptions: { ... }
});

const browser2 = await client.puppeteer.connect(session2);
const page2 = (await browser2.pages())[0];

await page2.goto('https://app.example.com/dashboard');
// Already logged in - cookies were restored from the profile
```

> **First run note:** On the very first run, there's no saved profile yet.
> This is normal. The profile file is created when `browser.close()` is called.
> Subsequent runs will find and load it.


### Profile File Format

Profiles are stored as JSON files at `.profiles/{profileId}.json`:

```json
{
    "id": "my-app-login",
    "cookies": [
        {
            "name": "session_token",
            "value": "abc123...",
            "domain": ".example.com",
            "path": "/",
            "expires": 1735689600,
            "httpOnly": true,
            "secure": true
        }
    ],
    "updatedAt": "2024-01-15T10:30:00.000Z"
}
```


### Manual Profile Management

Beyond the automatic `profileId` flow, you can manage profiles directly:

```typescript
// Save a profile manually
await client.profiles.saveProfile('my-profile', page, { note: 'after login' });

// Load a profile into a page
await client.profiles.loadProfile('my-profile', page);

// List all saved profiles
const profiles = await client.profiles.listProfiles();

// Delete a profile
await client.profiles.deleteProfile('my-profile');
```


### Profiles vs Context Service

| | Context Service | Profile Service |
|---|---|---|
| **Where state lives** | In memory (JS object) | On disk (`.profiles/` directory) |
| **Lifetime** | Single script run | Across runs (days/weeks) |
| **Use case** | Transfer state between sessions in the same script | Maintain login state between separate agent invocations |
| **How to use** | Manual `getContext()` / `setContext()` | Automatic via `profileId` in session config |

**Use Context** when your agent creates multiple sessions in one run.
**Use Profiles** when your agent runs on a schedule and needs to stay logged in
between invocations.


### Works With All CDP Adapters

- **Puppeteer:** Saves/loads cookies via CDP page methods
- **Playwright:** Saves/loads cookies via `context.addCookies()` / `context.cookies()`
- **Selenium:** Saves/loads cookies via `driver.manage().addCookie()`, grouped by domain


### Security Note

Profile files contain session cookies and tokens in plain text. Add
`.profiles/` to your `.gitignore`:

```
.profiles/
```
