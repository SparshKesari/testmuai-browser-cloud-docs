# Stealth Mode

Make your agent's browser look like a real human user to bot-detection systems.


### Why Stealth Matters

When you automate a browser with Puppeteer or Playwright, it leaves detectable
fingerprints. Bot detection systems on the target site check for things like:

- `navigator.webdriver` is set to `true`
- Missing Chrome plugins and runtime objects
- Exact, round viewport dimensions like `1920x1080`
- Identical user-agent strings across all sessions
- Inhuman interaction speeds - instant clicks, perfectly uniform typing

If any of these checks fail, your agent gets blocked, served a CAPTCHA, or
shown different content than a real user would see.

Stealth mode in the TestMu Browser SDK removes or fakes these fingerprints, so
the cloud browser is indistinguishable from a regular human user's Chrome
session.


### Enabling Stealth

Add a `stealthConfig` to your session. That's it - the adapter handles
everything else automatically:

```typescript
const session = await client.sessions.create({
    adapter: 'puppeteer',
    stealthConfig: {
        humanizeInteractions: true,
        randomizeUserAgent: true,
        randomizeViewport: true,
    },
    lambdatestOptions: { ... }
});
```


### Configuration Reference

| Option | Type | Default | What It Does |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `humanizeInteractions` | `boolean` | `false` | Adds random delays to clicks (50–150ms) and typing (30–130ms per character) |
| `randomizeUserAgent` | `boolean` | `true` | Picks a random user-agent from a pool of 7 realistic Chrome/Firefox strings |
| `randomizeViewport` | `boolean` | `true` | Adds ±20px random jitter to viewport dimensions |
| `skipFingerprintInjection` | `boolean` | `false` | Disables all stealth entirely (Puppeteer only, useful for comparison testing) |


### What Gets Patched

The specific evasions depend on which adapter you're using.

**Puppeteer** uses `puppeteer-extra` with the stealth plugin. This is the most
comprehensive stealth solution available, patching:

- `navigator.webdriver` (set to `undefined`)
- Chrome runtime objects
- WebGL vendor/renderer
- Permission queries
- Language and platform strings
- iframe contentWindow access
- Console.debug behavior
- And approximately 15 more evasions

**Playwright** uses custom scripts injected via `page.addInitScript()`. These
scripts run **before** any page JavaScript executes, so detection scripts
cannot observe the original values:

| Evasion | What It Does |
|---------|-------------|
| `navigator.webdriver = false` | Hides the automation flag |
| Fake `chrome.runtime` | Makes it look like Chrome extensions are present |
| Fake `navigator.plugins` | Injects 3 standard Chrome plugins (PDF Plugin, PDF Viewer, Native Client) |
| `navigator.languages` | Set to `['en-US', 'en']` |
| `permissions.query` | Returns `'denied'` for notifications (matches real Chrome) |
| WebGL spoofing | Reports "Intel Inc." / "Intel Iris OpenGL Engine" as GPU |

> **Selenium** does not support stealth mode. Use Puppeteer or Playwright if
> your agent needs anti-detection.


### User-Agent Randomization

When `randomizeUserAgent` is enabled (it is by default when any `stealthConfig`
is set), the SDK picks from a pool of 7 realistic user-agent strings covering
Chrome 119–120 and Firefox 121 on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

The user-agent is selected **once** at session creation and stays consistent for
the entire session. This is important - changing user-agent mid-session is a
detection signal.

If you provide an explicit `userAgent` in the session config, it takes priority
over randomization.


### Viewport Randomization

When `randomizeViewport` is enabled, the SDK adds ±20 pixels of random jitter
to your base viewport dimensions. Instead of the perfectly round `1920x1080`
that bots typically fingerprint as, your session might run at `1907x1063` -
subtly different each time.


### Humanized Interactions

When `humanizeInteractions` is enabled, the SDK monkey-patches interaction
methods to add random delays:

| Method | Adapter | Delay |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `page.click(selector)` | Puppeteer, Playwright | Random 50–150ms before clicking |
| `page.type(selector, text)` | Puppeteer, Playwright | Random 30–130ms between each character |
| `page.fill(selector, value)` | Playwright only | Random 50–150ms before filling |

New pages created during the session automatically inherit the same humanized
behavior.


### Disabling Stealth

To explicitly disable stealth (useful for comparison testing or sites that
don't use bot detection):

```typescript
const session = await client.sessions.create({
    adapter: 'puppeteer',
    stealthConfig: {
        skipFingerprintInjection: true,
        randomizeUserAgent: false,
        randomizeViewport: false,
    },
    lambdatestOptions: { ... }
});
```


### Testing Your Stealth Setup

The TestMu Browser SDK includes a built-in test that visits the bot detection
site `bot.sannysoft.com` with stealth ON and OFF, saving screenshots for visual
comparison:

```bash
npm run build
npx ts-node test-features/08-stealth-mode.ts
```

Screenshots are saved to `test-output/`. Stealth ON shows green checks; stealth
OFF shows red failures.


### How It Works Internally

```
Session Creation
    │
    ├─ stealthConfig present?
    │   ├─ Yes → pick random UA, store on session.userAgent
    │   └─ No  → skip
    │
    ▼
Adapter.connect()
    │
    ├─ Puppeteer:
    │   ├─ skipFingerprintInjection? → raw puppeteer.connect()
    │   └─ else → puppeteerExtra.connect() with stealth plugin
    │       ├─ Set random UA via page.setUserAgent()
    │       ├─ Set random viewport via page.setViewport()
    │       └─ Humanize: monkey-patch click/type
    │
    └─ Playwright:
        ├─ Inject stealth scripts via page.addInitScript()
        ├─ Auto-apply to new pages via context.on('page')
        ├─ Set random UA via page.evaluate()
        ├─ Set random viewport via page.setViewportSize()
        └─ Humanize: monkey-patch click/type/fill
```
